    	<h2>First we learn structure</h2>
    		<p>HTML is where we start when we are build a webpage. This is because HTML is the structure of a website. HTML stands for hyper text markup language. A make up language is not a programming language that can control a computer, but just for making up text.</p>
    	<h3>Once our structure is built, we'll beautify our page</h3>
    		<p>CSS or cascading style sheets are what we use to make a page more that just basic text and shapes. CSS can transform our website into a work of art.</p>
		<h4>Finally we will bring our page to life with Javascript</h4>
    		<p>Until recently JS was the most widely used language in the world and it's easy to see why. Javascript can bring webpages to live with effects, animation, and rich content.</p>
