        <h2>Recent Brews</h2>
        <h3>Blue Moon Clone</h3>
          <p>For this brew, done in Jan 2019, I used a Blue Moon clone kit but I doubled up on the marmalade for extra oranginess. The result was a bit like a wheat sour as the orange flavor is strong but a bit tart. Over all it was well received and with 5 gallons left in the keg I have pleny to bottle for picnics this summer!</p>
          
        <h3>Belgian Dubbel</h3>
          <p>For this brew, November 2018, I used a Chimmay Red kit to brew just over 10 gallons. This was the first time using my new brew pot and a new type of belgian yeast. The results were a very nice banana bread aroma and a very drinkable beer for 9.1% ABV. The beer did turn out a bit sweet and I think a bit more time fermenting to clean up residual sugars could have been beneficial. I'll age a few bottles for a year and see how they turn out.</p>
